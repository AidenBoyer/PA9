This is a simple game called Galaxy Shooter, 
inspired by classics such as Galaga and Space Invaders.
While basic and unfinished in its current state, this game
places you in your trusty starship, facing down wave after wave of endless alien invaders.
Be cautious, as both you and the aliens possess advanced weaponry capable of destroying the other on impact!

This game also features online networking via a leaderboard that shows the top 5 players in terms of waves
survived.

Controls: WASD to move up, left, down, and up. Use space bar to shoot.
